Dear Terry,

How are you doing? In your last letter, you asked me about being a guest to a Chinese friend¡¯s home. Now, I am writing to inform you of some relevant details.

To begin with, according to our tradition, you are supposed to arrive early, so that you can help the family prepare the dinner, which is meaningful and interesting. Besides, you¡¯d better bring some gifts, like a book or a Chinese knot. What¡¯s more, when you are enjoying the meal, you need to avoid making noises while chewing food.

Hopefully, these suggestions would be helpful for you. I have the confidence that you will have a great time.

Best wishes!

Yours,
